# RUM talk 12-9-18
# 1200-1300
# Zochonis Building B22

The script and data underlying my talk are available in this repository. The script is available both as an .R file, as an RMarkdown document, and as a knitted .html file.  If you want to view the .html file, you will probably need to first download it and then open it in a browser.  Some browsers (e.g., Safari) will append the file with an extra .txt extension. You'll need to delete that leaving just the .html extension.

Hope you enjoy the talk.  Any questions, just contact me via email (andrew.stewart@manchester.ac.uk) or on Twitter (@ajstewart_lang)

Happy coding!
